# NO3 - A Notation3 inference engine

NO3 is a small forward-chaining inference engine for a subset of the [Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) language.

## SYNOPSIS

```
const parse    = require("../js/parse.js");
const reasoner = require("../js/reasoner.js");

const parsedN3 = await parse.parseN3(n3String);
const inferred = await reasoner.think(parsedN3);
const str      = await parse.store2string(inferred);
```

## Notation3 support

All NO3 formulas need to be simple:

- No cited formulas
- No paths
- No backward-chaining `<=`
- No owl:sameAs symbol `=`
- Limited support for built-ins (at this moment NONE)

A supported formula:

```
{ ?X :cooks ?Y. } => { ?Y :isCookedBy ?X . } .
```

An unsupported formula:

```
{ ?X :says { ?X :cooks ?Y } } => { ?X :means { ?Y :isCookedBy ?X } } .
```

NO3 does support simple inferences:

Given:

```
:Socrates a :Man.
:Man rdfs:subClassOf :Mortal.

{
    ?A rdfs:subClassOf ?B. 
    ?S a ?A.
} => 
{
    ?S a ?B
}.
```

Results in:

```
:Socrates a :Mortal.
```

Formules can be given in any order:

Given:

```
:Hank :cooks :Soup .

{ ?X :isCookedBy ?Y . } => { ?X :isOnMenuOf ?Y . }.

{ ?X :cooks ?Y. } => { ?Y :isCookedBy ?X . } .
```

Results in (irrespective of order of formulas):

```
:Soup :isCookedBy :Hank;
    :isOnMenuOf :Hank.
```

Support for existential and universal quantifiers.

Given:

```
:Hank :plays :Guitar.
:Emily :plays :Piano.

:Guitar a :MusicInstrument .
:Piano a :MusicInstrument .

{ ?S :plays [ a :MusicInstrument ] .  } => { ?S :canEnter :Recital. }.
```

Results in:

```
:Hank :canEnter :Recital .
:Emily :canEnter :Recital .
```

## Raison d'Ãªtre

NO3 was developed to have basic Notation3 support in JavaScript for environments
that don't require all features of a [CWM](https://github.com/sbp/cwm) or [EYE](https://josd.github.io/eye/) processor.

## Naming

NO3 read as Notation 0.3 (because the lack of features) and interpreted as the chemical compound 
Nitrate (NO-3), which can be a fertilizer but also an explosive (not because it is explosive fast,
..actually it is very slow compared to EYE).

This code was written for the Mellon Project "Scholarly Communication on the decentralized web" as
a proof of concept.
